# BovControl Code Challenge

## Weather and Forecast App

The app was developed using raw React Native, without Expo. The project was scaffolded by using `react-native init` using the template for TypeScript. It was tested only on Android, being possible that it does not work at all on iOS.

Libs used:

- axios
- styled-components
- react-native-geolocation-service
- async-storage
- react-native-config

Features:

- Current Weather info
- 7 days forecast with min and max temperature
- Refresh by sliding down
- Refresh automatically by an interval

## Instalation and running instructions

- Ensure that your Android development environment is all set
- Run `yarn` to install all dependencies
- Create a .env file at the root folder. Here is the file used by me:

```
API_BASE_URL=http://apiadvisor.climatempo.com.br
API_TOKEN=2251314f614b224998f34f7adb2fb4f6
REFRESH_INTERVAL=30000
```

- run `yarn android` to launch the app. If there's errors, try making the project with Android Studio and after that run the command again.
- As the Clima Tempo free API only allows one location, the above token utilizes Tubar√£o - SC. All other cities will throw an error.
- Make sure to adjust the geolocation config in your emulator to the correct city.

## Observations

Changing locations on the AVD emulator doens't seem to affect the app directly (latitude and longitude doesn't change even with the setting of `maximumAge: 0`). My solution for this was installing a weather/forecast app from the Play Store and updating it, after this the location changed in my app too.
